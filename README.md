# MoodMatch

MoodMatch is a mood-based matching app built in Swift Playgrounds. It connects teens based on how they feel, allowing them to chat and support each other. If no match is available, a supportive bot responds and shares a mood-based video to help the user feel better.

##  Why This Matters

Teen mental health is becoming a serious issue. Many teens feel isolated, stressed, or anxious, but they don’t always have a safe space to talk about their feelings. Social media can make these emotions worse, because it often encourages comparison instead of connection.

MoodMatch creates a supportive community where teens can connect with someone who understands their mood — even if it’s just for a few minutes. The goal is to reduce loneliness and encourage emotional support.

##  How MoodMatch Works

1. **Login / Signup**
   - Users log in to create a safe, anonymous environment.
2. **Select Mood**
   - Users choose how they’re feeling.
3. **Find Match**
   - The app searches for someone with the same mood.
4. **Chat**
   - If a match is found, users can chat using mood-based prompts.
5. **Bot Support**
   - If no match is available, a supportive bot responds and shares a video that matches the user’s mood.
